This package ("Original Work") is licensed under the terms of the Bootstrap Open

In this document,

- "Zcash" means the blockchain defined by the most recent agreement between
  the Electric Coin Company and the Zcash Foundation according to section 6.2 (b)
  of the Zcash Trademark Agreement.
- A "Zcash Chain Fork" means a blockchain that descends from the Zcash
  blockchain and that is or was forked within 3456 blocks of the current block
  height of the Zcash blockchain at the time of the fork;
- A "Zcash Technology Testnet" means a blockchain designed for the purpose of
  testing technology potentially of use to the Zcash blockchain and not for
  the purpose of implementing any token of economic value, where this purpose
  and lack of such economic value are clearly communicated to its users and to
  the general public.

Only if this Original Work is included as part of the distribution of one of the
following (each, the "Project"):

- A project that implements Zcash;
- A project that implements a Zcash Chain Fork;
- A project that implements a Zcash Technology Testnet;
- A project that is designed to integrate with Zcash (whether or not it can
  also integrate with one or more Zcash Chain Forks), and that provides
  additional functionality or utility to the Zcash network and holders of
  the ZEC coin;

then License is granted to use the Original Work under the BOSL as modified by
the following clarification and special exception. This exception applies only
to the Original Work when linked or combined with the Project and not to the
Original Work when linked, combined, or included in or with any other software
or project or on a standalone basis.

For the avoidance of doubt, "a project that implements Zcash" includes, but is
not limited to, the Zcash projects published by the Electric Coin Company and
the Zebra project published by the Zcash Foundation.

    Under the terms of the BOSL, linking or combining this Original Work with
    the Project creates a Derivative Work based upon the Original Work and the
    terms of the BOSL thus apply to both the Original Work and that Derivative
    Work. As a special exception to the BOSL, and to allow this Original Work to
    be linked and combined with the Project without having to apply the BOSL to
    the other portions of the Project, you are granted permission to link or
    combine this Original Work with the Project and to copy and distribute the
    resulting work ("Resulting Work") under the open source license applicable
    to the Project ("Project License"), provided that any portions of this
    Original Work included in the Resulting Work remain subject to the BOSL. For
    clarity, you may continue to treat all other portions of the Project under
    the Project License, provided that you comply with the BOSL with respect to
    the Original Work. If you modify this Original Work, your version of the
    Original Work must remain under the BOSL. You may also extend this exception
    to your version, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to
    do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
